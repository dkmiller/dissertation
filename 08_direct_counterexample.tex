\chapter{Direct counterexample}





\section{Main ideas}

Todo: first just construct the ``fake integral Satake parameters.'' The 
results here are very strong!

The goal for this chapter is to construct a Galois representation 
$\rho_l\colon G_\bQ \to \GL_2(\bZ_l)$, ramified at a density-zero set of 
primes, such that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item
We have $a_p = \tr \rho(\frob_p)\in \bZ$ whenever $\rho_l$ is unramified at 
$p$. 

\item
$|a_p|\leqslant 2\sqrt p$. ($\rho_l$ satisfies the Hasse bound.)

\item
For $\theta_p=\cos^{-1}a_p / 2\sqrt p)$, the discrepancy 
$\disc^\star(\btheta^N,\ST)\to 0$, but slower than any $N^{-\epsilon}$. 

\item
For any smooth $f\in C^\infty(\bR/2\pi\bZ)$ such that 
$f(\pi-\theta) = -f(\theta)$, the associated $L$-function 
$L_f(\btheta,s)$ satisfies the Riemann Hypothesis. 
\end{enumerate}

These points together imply that $\rho_l$ satisfies the Sato--Tate conjecture, 
and $L(\sym^k \rho_l,s)$ satisfy the Riemann Hypothesis for odd $k$, but that 
$\rho_l$ does not satisfy the strong Sato--Tate conjecture. 





\section{Construction}

Fix, for the remainder of this section, a continuous representation 
\[
	\bar\rho_l \colon G_\bQ \to \GL_2(\bF_l) .
\]
For each $p$ at which $\bar\rho_l$ is unramified, we write 
\[
	\Theta_p(\bar\rho_l) = \left\{\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{a}{2\sqrt p}\right) : a\in \bZ\text{, }|a|\leqslant 2\sqrt p\text{, and }a\equiv \tr\bar\rho_l(\frob_p)\pmod l\right\} .
\]
For the finitely many primes $p$ for which $\Theta_p(\bar\rho_l)$ is empty, 
redefine $\Theta_p(\bar\rho_l)$ to include some elements for which 
$|a|>2\sqrt p$. We have a sequence of $\Theta_p(\bar\rho_l)$ for which at most 
finitely many do not satisfy the Hasse bound. 

\begin{theorem}
There exists a choice of $\theta_p\in \Theta_p(\bar\rho_l)$ for odd-indexed 
primes $\{2,5,11,\dots\}$ such that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item
$\theta_p\in [0,\pi/2)$ for all but finitely many $p$. 

\item
$\disc\left(\btheta_\odd^N, \left.\ST\right|_{[0,\pi/2)}\right) \to 0$, 
but is not $\ll N^{-\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon>0$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
This is intuitively obvious, but a bit tricky to prove rigorously. 

Two key ideas: 

1. If we're given a ``bad'' finite distribution $\nu$, we can choose ``good'' 
$\theta_p$'s to make the combined distribution close enough (discrepancy-wise) 
to $\ST$. 

2. If we're given a ``good'' finite distribution $\nu$, we can choose ``bad'' 
$\theta_p\sim \pi/2$ to make the combined distribution far away 
(discrepancy-wise) from $\ST$. 
\end{proof}

Claim: let $\mu,\nu$ be two absolutely continuous distributions. Suppose there 
is a sequence $\{T_p\}$ of $\mu$-distributed sets, such that 
$\disc(T_p,\mu) \ll p^{-1/2}$. Suppose moreover that $\mu/\nu$ is bounded away 
from zero (at the pdf side). Then we can choose $t_p\in T_p$ so that 
$\{t_p\}$ is $\nu$-equidistributed with good discrepancy. 





\section{Associated Galois representation}

Let $\mu$ be an absolutely continuous measure on $[0,\pi]$ such that the 
pushforward $\cos_\ast \mu$ is bounded (this is true for the Sato--Tate 
measure). Fix a prime $l\geqslant 5$ and a constant $\alpha\in (0,1/2]$. We 
want to construct a weight-$2$ Galois representation 
$\rho_l\colon G_\bQ \to \GL_2(\bZ_l)$, ramified at a density zero set of 
primes, such that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item
If $\rho_l$ is unramified at $p$, then $a_p = \tr \rho_l(\frob_p)\in \bZ$ and 
satisfies the Hasse bound $|a_p| \leqslant 2\sqrt p$. 

\item
If we write $\theta_p = \cos^{-1}(a_p / 2\sqrt p)$ for the Satake parameters at 
unramified primes, then $\disc(\btheta^N, \mu) \ll N^{-\alpha+\epsilon}$ and 
$\disc(\btheta^N,\mu) = \Omega(N^{-\alpha-\epsilon})$. 
\end{enumerate}

Recall the van der Corput sequence $\{x_p\}$ satisfies 
$\disc(\bx^N) \ll N^{-1+\epsilon}$. Let $\nu = \cos_\ast \mu$; this is an 
absolutely continuous measure supported on $[-1,1]$. By transforming the 
van der Corput sequence by a continuous map, we may assume that in fact 
$\disc(\bx^N,\nu) \ll N^{-1+\epsilon}$. In fact, by alternating between 
``van der Corput elements'' and ``bad elements'' we can ensure that not 
only does $\disc(\bx^N,\nu) \ll N^{-\alpha+\epsilon}$, but also 
$\disc(\bx^N,\nu) = \Omega(N^{-\alpha-\epsilon})$. 

We start by choosing a modular mod-$l$ representation 
$\rho_1\colon G_\bQ \to \GL_2(\bZ/l)$, which is ramified at a finite set of 
primes $S_1$. Let $R_1 = \{p\leqslant r_1 : p \notin S_1\}$. For $p\in R_1$, 
we can choose $a_p\in \bZ$ subject only to the condition 
$a_p \equiv \tr \rho_1(\frob_p)\pmod l$. For any $p\in R_1$, the set 
\[
	T_p(l) = \left\{\frac{a}{2\sqrt p} : |a| \leqslant 2\sqrt p\text{ and }a\equiv \tr \rho_1(\frob_p)\pmod l\right\}
\]
has an element within $l p^{-1/2}$ of any element of $[-1,1]$. Choose 
$a_p\in T_p(l)$ so that 
$\left|\frac{a_p}{2\sqrt p} - x_p\right| \leqslant l p^{-1/2}$. It follows 
that for $p\in R_1$, we have 
\[
	|\disc(\{a_p/2\sqrt p\}_{p\leqslant N}, \nu) - \disc(\bx^N,\nu)| \ll l N^{-1/2}
\]
We get a lift of $\rho_1$ to $\rho_2\colon G_\bQ \to \GL_2(\bZ/l^2)$ respecting 
our choices of the $a_p$ for $p\in R_1$, which is ramified at one (perhaps two) 
extra primes. 


What happens next is in stages. We'll already have a mod-$l^{n+1}$ 
representation $\rho_{n+1}\colon G_\bQ \to \GL_2(\bZ/l^n)$, together with 
choices of $a_p$ for $p\in R_1\cup \cdots \cup R_n$ that ensure 
$|\disc(\{a_p / 2\sqrt p\}_{p\leqslant N}, \nu) - \disc(\bx^N,\nu)| \ll ?$


The main question is: how do we choose $r_1$, and the later $r_n$? We ensure 
that a) the set $T_p(l^n)$ are non-empty, and that b) $l^n < \log(r_n)$. This 
gives us that for $N\leqslant r_n$, we have 
\[
	|\disc(\{a_p / 2\sqrt p\}_{p\leqslant N}, \nu) - \disc(\bx^N,\nu)| \ll N^{-\frac 1 2+\epsilon} .
\]

Todo: can I make $\sum a_p = ?$ anything from $-\infty$ to $\infty$?

What if I make a fake modular form with these ``bad'' Satake parameters? What 
can I say about it?





\section{Informal approach}

This discussion is inspired by \cite{pande-2011}. Throughout, all Galois 
representations have weight $2$, i.e.~determinant is the cyclotomic power. 

Fix a prime $l\geqslant 5$ and a (modular) representation 
$\rho_1\colon G_\bQ \to \GL_2(\bZ/l)$. We claim that there is a finite set 
$S$ such that $\sha_S^1(\Ad^0\rho_1) = \sha_S^2(\Ad^0 \rho_1) = 0$. Moreover, 
all the local deformation spaces are smooth? (Why?)

Set $S=S_2$. Choose lifts $\rho_p\colon G_{\bQ_p} \to \GL_2(\bZ_l)$ of 
$\left.\rho_1\right|_{G_{\bQ_p}}$ for all $p\in S_2$. We can ensure that the 
$\rho_p$ are ramified. (Can we also ensure that their characteristic 
polynomials are well behaved? By \cite{khare-rajan-2001}, these 
characteristic polynomials are well-defined for all but finitely many primes.)
Now let $R_2 = \{p\notin S_2 : p\leqslant r_2\}$, where $r_2$ is a yet 
unspecified large constant (say $l^{l^{100}}$). Choose $a_p$ for all 
$p\in R_2$. By \cite[Lem.~5.1]{pande-2011}, there is a set $Q_2$ (bound the 
size of $Q_2$!)
