Brief biographical sketch.
\end{biosketch}

\begin{dedication}
This thesis is dedicated to my undergraduate thesis advisor, Griff Elder. 
He is the reason I considered a career in math, his infectious enthusiasm for 
number theory has inspired me more than I can say. 
\end{dedication}

\begin{acknowledgements}
For starters, I'd like to thank my parents Jay and Cindy for noticing and 
fostering my mathematical interests early on, and for being loving and 
supportive the whole way through. I'd also like to thank my undergraduate 
thesis advisor, Griffith Elder, without whose encouragement and inspiration 
I'd probably never have considered a career in math. 

Thanks to my graduate student friends Sasha Patotski and Bal\'azs Elek for 
sharing my early love of algebraic geometry, for laughing with me at the 
absurdities of academic life, and listening to my ramblings about number 
theory long after they'd stopped being interesting. 

I owe a big debt of gratitude to the mathematics department at Cornell---so 
many professors were generous with their time and ideas. I especially 
appreciate Birgit Speh, Yuri Berest, David Zywina, Farbod Shokrieh, and John 
Hubbard for letting me bounce ideas off them, helping me add rigor to 
half-baked ideas, and pointing me in new and exciting directions. 

I am especially thankful to my advisor Ravi. He kindled my first love for 
number theory, and stayed supportive as my research bounced all over the place, 
and helped focus and ground my thesis when I needed concrete results. 

Lastly, I thank my loving wife Ivy for being there for me through the highs and 
the lows---both when I (prematurely) thought my thesis was complete, and when I 
thought my results were completely in shambles. I couldn't have done it 
without her.
