\chapter{Discrepancy}





\section{Definitions and first results}

regular discrepancy

star discrepancy

Euclidean space vs.~torus





\section{Comparing sequences}

If $\{x_n\}\subset [0,\pi/2)$ has some discrepancy with respect to some 
measure, then the ``flipped'' sequence $\{\pi/2-x_n\}$ has the same discrepancy 
with respect to the ``flipped'' measure. 





\section{Combining sequences}

If $\{x_n\}$ and $\{y_n\}$ are sequences supported on $[0,\pi/2)$ and 
$[\pi/2,\pi)$ respectively, and both are equidistributed with respect to 
measures supported on their respective intervals, then the ``interleaved'' 
sequence $(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,\dots)$ also has equidistribution (with respect to 
the combined measure) and discrepancy which decays no faster than the slower of 
the two.
