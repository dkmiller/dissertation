\chapter{Introduction}





Let's start with something basic, an elliptic curve $E_{/\bQ}$. For any 
prime $l$, we have the Tate module of $E$, written $\tate_l E$. This is a 
rank-$2$ $\bZ_l$-module with continuous $G_\bQ$-action, so it induces a 
continuous representation 
\[
	\rho_{E,l} \colon G_\bQ \to \GL_2(\bZ_l) .
\]
It is known (citation?) that the quantities $a_p(E) = \tr \rho_l(\frob_p)$ lie 
in $\bZ$ and satisfy the Hasse bound 
\[
	|a_p(E)| < 2\sqrt p .
\]
Thus we can define, for each prime $p$, the corresponding Satake parameter for 
$E$. 
\[
	\theta_p(E) = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{a_p(E)}{2\sqrt p}\right) \in [0,\pi) .
\]
The Satake parameters are packaged into an $L$-function as follows:
\[
	L(E,s) = \prod_p \frac{1}{(1 - e^{i \theta_p(E)} p^{-s})(1- e^{-i \theta_p(E)} p^{-s})} .
\]

Theorem: analytic continuation of $L(E,s)$ past $\Re s=1$ is equivalent to the 
Sato--Tate conjecture, namely that the $\theta_p(E)$ are equidistributed. 

Rephrase equidistribution. 

So S--T is equivalent to discrepancy being $o(N)$. 

Riemann Hypothesis is implied by A--T. 

Does converse hold?

No! We'll construct two classes of counterexamples. 

And also provide computational evidence for the A--T conjecture (for elliptic 
curves and also generic abelian $2$-folds).
