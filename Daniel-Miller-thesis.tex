\begin{abstract}
Let $E_{/\bQ}$ be an elliptic curve. The Sato--Tate conjecture, now a theorem, 
tells us that the angles $\theta_p =\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{a_p}{2\sqrt p}\right)$ 
are equidistributed in $[0,\pi]$ with respect to the measure 
$\frac{2}{\pi}\sin^2\theta\, \dd\theta$ if $E$ is non-CM
(resp.~$\frac{1}{2\pi} \dd \theta + \frac 1 2 \delta_{\pi/2}$ if $E$ is CM). 
In the non-CM case, Akiyama and Tanigawa conjecture that the discrepancy 
\[
	D_N = \sup_{x\in [0,\pi]} \left| \frac{1}{\pi(N)} \sum_{p\leqslant N} 1_{[0,x]}(\theta_p) - \int_0^x \frac{2}{\pi}\sin^2\theta\, \dd\theta\right| 
\]
asymptotically decays like $N^{-\frac 1 2+\epsilon}$, as is suggested by computational 
evidence and certain reasonable heuristics on the Kolmogorov--Smirnov 
statistic. This conjecture implies the Riemann Hypothesis 
for all $L$-functions associated with $E$. It is natural to assume that the 
converse (``Riemann Hypothesis implies discrepancy estimate'') holds, as is 
suggested by analogy with Artin $L$-functions. We construct, for CM abelian 
varieties, ``fake Satake parameters'' yielding $L$-functions which satisfy 
the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, but for which the discrepancy decays like 
$N^{-\epsilon}$. This provides evidence that in the CM case, the converse to 
``Akiyama--Tanigawa implies GRH'' does not hold. 

We also show that there are Galois representations 
$\rho\colon \Gal(\overline \bQ /\bQ) \to \GL_2(\bZ_l)$, ramified at an 
arbitrarily thin set of primes, whose Satake parameters can be made to 
converge at any specified rate to any fixed measure $\mu$ on $[0,\pi]$ for 
which $\cos_\ast\mu$ is absolutely continuous.

\begin{biosketch}
Daniel Miller was born in St.~Paul, Minnesota. He completed his Bachelor of 
Science at the University of Nebraska--Omaha. In addition to his studies there, 
he played the piano competitively and attended Cornell's Summer Mathematics 
Institute. He started his Ph.D.~at Cornell planning on a career in academia. 
Halfway through he had a change of heart, and will be joining Microsoft's 
Analysis and Experimentation team as a data scientist after graduation. He is 
happily married to Ivy Lai Miller, and has a cute but grumpy cat named Socrates.

\begin{dedication}
This thesis is dedicated to my undergraduate adviser, Griff Elder. He is the 
reason I considered a career in mathematics, and his infectious enthusiasm 
for number theory has inspired me more than I can say. 
\end{dedication}

\begin{acknowledgements}
I could not have completed this thesis without help and support from many 
people. I would like to offer my sincerest thanks to the following people. 

To my parents Jay and Cindy for noticing and fostering my mathematical 
interests early on, and for being unfailingly loving and supportive. 

To my undergraduate thesis advisor, Griffith Elder. Without his encouragement 
and inspiration I probably would have never considered a career in math. 

To Tara Holm, Jason Boynton, and Anthony Weston for making the 2011 Summer 
Mathematics Institute the fantastic introduction to research it was. 

To my fellow graduate students Sasha Patotski, Bal\'azs Elek, and Sergio Da 
Silva for sharing my early love of algebraic geometry, laughing with me at the 
absurdities of academic life, and listening to my ramblings about number theory. 

To the mathematics department at Cornell, where many professors were generous 
with their time and ideas. I appreciate Yuri Berest, John Hubbard, Farbod 
Shokrieh, Birget Speh, and David Zywina for letting me bounce ideas off them, 
helping me add rigor to half-baked ideas, and pointing me in new and 
interesting directions of research. 

To my adviser Ravi Ramakrishna. He kindled my first love for number theory, 
stayed supportive as my research bounced all over the place, and kept me 
focused, grounded, and concrete when I needed to be. 

Most importantly, to my loving wife Ivy for being there for me through the highs 
and the lows, both when I prematurely thought my thesis was complete, and when I 
thought my results were completely in shambles. I couldn't have done it without 
her.
