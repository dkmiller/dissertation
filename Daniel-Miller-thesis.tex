\begin{abstract}
Let $E_{/\bQ}$ be an elliptic curve. The Sato--Tate conjecture (now a theorem) 
tells us that the angles $\theta_p =\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{a_p}{2\sqrt p}\right)$ 
are equidistributed in $[0,\pi]$ with respect to the measure 
$\frac{2}{\pi}\sin^2\theta$ 
(resp.~$\frac{1}{2\pi} \dd \theta + \frac 1 2 \delta_{\pi/2}$) if $E$ is non-CM 
(resp.~CM). Call $\mu$ the measure in question. Akiyama and Tanigawa conjecture 
that in fact, the discrepancy 
\[
	D_N = \sup_{x\in [0,\pi]} \left| \frac{1}{\pi(N)} \sum_{p\leqslant N} 1_{[0,x]}(\theta_p) - \int 1_{[0,x]} \, \dd\mu\right| 
\]
decays as $D_N \ll N^{-\frac 1 2+\epsilon}$, as is suggested by computational 
evidence and certain reasonable heuristics. This implies the Riemann Hypothesis 
for all $L$-functions associated with $E$. It is natural to assume that the 
converse holds, as is suggested by analogy with the Riemann Hypothesis for 
Artin $L$-functions. We show that when $E$ has CM, there is no 
reason to believe that the converse holds, as there are ``fake Satake 
parameters'' yielding $L$-functions which satisfy the Generalized Riemann 
Hypothesis, but for which the discrepancy decays like $N^{-\epsilon}$. 

We also show that there are Galois representations 
$\rho\colon \Gal(\overline \bQ /\bQ) \to \GL_2(\bZ_l)$, ramified at an 
arbitrarily thin set of primes, whose Satake parameters can be made to 
converge at any specified rate to any reasonable measure on $[0,\pi]$.

\begin{biosketch}
Daniel Miller was born in St.~Paul, Minnesota. He completed his Bachelor of 
Science at the University of Nebraska--Omaha, during which he attended 
Cornell's Summer Mathematics Institute in 2011. He started his Ph.D.~at 
Cornell in 2012 planning on a career in academia. Halfway through he had a 
change of heart, and will be joining Microsoft's Analysis and Experimentation 
team as a Data Scientist after graduation. He is happily married to Ivy 
Lai Miller, and enjoys hiking, exploring new food, and martial arts.

\begin{dedication}
This thesis is dedicated to my undergraduate adviser, Griff Elder. 
He is the reason I considered a career in mathematics in the first place, and 
his infectious enthusiasm for number theory has inspired me more than I can 
say. 
\end{dedication}

\begin{acknowledgements}
For starters, I'd like to thank my parents Jay and Cindy for noticing and 
fostering my mathematical interests early on, and for being loving and 
supportive the whole way through. I'd also like to thank my undergraduate 
thesis advisor, Griffith Elder, without whose encouragement and inspiration 
I probably never would have considered a career in math. 

I'd like to thank Tara Holm for organizing Cornell's Summer Mathematics 
Institute in 2011, Jason Boynton for teaching a fantastic algebra class, and 
Anthony Weston for introducing me to the world of nonlinear functional 
analysis. 

Thanks to my graduate student friends Sasha Patotski and Bal\'azs Elek for 
sharing my early love of algebraic geometry, for laughing with me at the 
absurdities of academic life, and listening to my ramblings about number 
theory long after they'd stopped being interesting. 

I owe a big debt of gratitude to the mathematics department at Cornell, where 
many professors were generous with their time and ideas. I especially 
appreciate Yuri Berest, John Hubbard, Farbod Shokrieh, Birget Speh, and David 
Zywina for letting me bounce ideas off them, helping me add rigor to 
half-baked ideas, and pointing me in new and exciting directions. 

I am especially thankful to my adviser Ravi. He kindled my first love for 
number theory, and stayed supportive as my research bounced all over the place, 
and kept me focused, grounded, and concrete when I needed to be. 

Most importantly, I thank my loving wife Ivy for being there for me 
through the highs and the lows, both when I (prematurely) thought my thesis was 
complete, and when I thought my results were completely in shambles. I couldn't 
have done it without her.
